# Changelog

## 2.3.1 - 04/12/2023

### Bug Fixes
- Items dropped at the bottom most position (outside of the rectangle of tree items, but still inside the tree container)
  will now be placed in the root item, at the final position, instead of the contents of the last open item (#261)



## 2.3.0 - 30/11/2023

### Breaking Changes
- Changed the behavior for dropping an item at the bottom of an open folder has changed, and will now drop
  into the open folder at its top, instead of the parent folder below the open folder. See discussion at #148 for details.
  You can opt out of this behavior by setting the `canDropBelowOpenFolders` prop on the tree environment (#148).

## 2.0.0 - 12/05/2022

### Breaking Changes
- Replaced `item.hasChildren` property with `item.isFolder`
- Replaced `environment.canDropOnItemWithChildren` property with `environment.canDropOnFolder`
- Replaced `environment.canDropOnItemWithoutChildren` property with `environment.canDropOnNonFolder`
- Replaced CSS classes related to `hasChildren` with `isFolder`, e.g. `rct-tree-item-li-hasChildren` to `rct-tree-item-li-isFolder`

Note: These properties were just renamed, but the functionality is the same. `hasChildren` has
always denoted whether an item is a folder or not, which confused a lot of people and was admittedly
very bad naming. The new name is a better reflection of its functionality. The other two properties
were renamed alongside to match.

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

- Upgraded library to React 18.
- Improved how "select up to" (i.e. shift+clicking) works, to match how users would expect it to work. The user can
  now create multiple distinct selection ranges by clicking and shift-clicking another item, then control clicking
  a different item and shift+control clicking a forth item.
- The function `treeItemActions.selectUpTo()` now accepts an optional boolean argument determining whether
  the previous selection range should be cleared before selecting the new range.
- Removed unnecessary memoization for event handlers, favoring stable callbacks stored in refs instead.
- Fixed a bug where renaming an item would make the page loose focus of the active tree.
- Items can now be dropped on empty trees. The tree container will need to be rendered with a minimum height for this
  to work, in the default renderers the container will now render with a minimum height of 30px, which can be adjusted
  in custom renderers.
- Fixed a bug where renaming from item renderer context was not working.

### Other Changes

- Added linter rules from airbnb config and fixed relevant issues. This fixed some memoization imperfections, which
  should improve performance.
- (Finally) added integration tests. This will ease the future development and help reduce regressions.

### Migration guide
- Replace the `hasChildren` property for tree items with `isFolder`.
- Replace the `canDropOnItemWithChildren` property on tree environment components or tree components with `canDropOnFolder`.
- Replace the `canDropOnItemWithoutChildren` property on tree environment components or tree components with `canDropOnNonFolder`.
- The upgrade of React to 18 should not require any changes on your end.
- If you are using custom interaction managers and want to benefit from the improved "select up to" functionality,
  replace `actions.selectUpTo()` with `actions.selectUpTo(!e.ctrlKey)` in the `onClick` handler.
- If you are overwriting CSS styles for rct-specific classes, replace `hasChildren` with `isFolder` in the class names.
