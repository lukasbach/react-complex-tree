# Multiple Trees

Multiple tree components can be added to a web app that can interact with one another. Drag and drop is possible
across several tree components such that items can be dragged from one tree to another. Although trees maintain
their own state on search and renaming, only one search input or renaming input is active at once across several
trees. Furthermore, trees maintain a shared state which makes synchronisation easier.

The requirement for multiple trees sharing drag-and-drop capabilities and state is that they are placed within the
same tree environment, i.e. either a shared `ControlledTreeEnvironment` or an `UncontrolledTreeEnvironment`.

## Example

```jsx live
<UncontrolledTreeEnvironment
  canDragAndDrop={true}
  canDropOnItemWithChildren={true}
  canReorderItems={true}
  dataProvider={new StaticTreeDataProvider(longTree.items, (item, data) => ({ ...item, data }))}
  getItemTitle={item => item.data}
  viewState={{}}
>
  <div
    style={{
      display: 'flex',
      justifyContent: 'space-evenly',
      alignItems: 'baseline',
      padding: '20px 0',
    }}
  >
    <div
      style={{
        width: '28%',
        backgroundColor: 'white',
      }}
    >
      <Tree treeId="tree-1" rootItem="root" treeLabel="Tree 1" />
    </div>
    <div
      style={{
        width: '28%',
        backgroundColor: 'white',
      }}
    >
      <Tree treeId="tree-2" rootItem="root" treeLabel="Tree 2" />
    </div>
    <div
      style={{
        width: '28%',
        backgroundColor: 'white',
      }}
    >
      <Tree treeId="tree-3" rootItem="root" treeLabel="Tree 3" />
    </div>
  </div>
</UncontrolledTreeEnvironment>
```

## Different root items per tree

It is not possible for several trees within the same environment to keep distinct states.
However, each tree can use a different item as root item, meaning that the trees can
still show different contents.

```jsx live
<UncontrolledTreeEnvironment
  canDragAndDrop={true}
  canDropOnItemWithChildren={true}
  canReorderItems={true}
  dataProvider={new StaticTreeDataProvider(longTree.items, (item, data) => ({ ...item, data }))}
  getItemTitle={item => item.data}
  viewState={{}}
>
  <div
    style={{
      display: 'flex',
      justifyContent: 'space-evenly',
      alignItems: 'baseline',
      padding: '20px 0',
    }}
  >
    <div
      style={{
        width: '28%',
        backgroundColor: 'white',
      }}
    >
      <Tree treeId="tree-4" rootItem="Fruit" treeLabel="Tree 1" />
    </div>
    <div
      style={{
        width: '28%',
        backgroundColor: 'white',
      }}
    >
      <Tree treeId="tree-5" rootItem="Meals" treeLabel="Tree 2" />
    </div>
    <div
      style={{
        width: '28%',
        backgroundColor: 'white',
      }}
    >
      <Tree treeId="tree-6" rootItem="Drinks" treeLabel="Tree 3" />
    </div>
  </div>
</UncontrolledTreeEnvironment>
```

## More than one environment

If you want several tree environments on one page that do not share state and dnd capabilities,
you can do that if several restrictions are obliged.

Each tree must have a unique tree ID which is even unique to trees in other environments
within the page.

Furthermore, an environment may not contain another tree environment. If this may cause problems
to your anticipated DOM structure, you can leverage React Portals to render the environments
disjunct from one another and still be free in the DOM structure you want to achieve.
