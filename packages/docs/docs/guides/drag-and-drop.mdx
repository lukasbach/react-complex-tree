# Drag and Drop Customizability

React Complex Tree provides advanced drag-and-drop capabilities that can easily be enabled via props on
the tree environment. Once they are enabled, drag works natively between as many trees as are rendered
within the environment. The user can also select multiple items (by pressing CTRL + left click on an item)
and drag all of them at once to a new location. See [Keyboard Bindings](/docs/guides/keyboard)
for more details on ways to select one or several items.

Also, drag and drop works also by only using the keyboard. This can be triggered by selecting one or several
items, then pressing `CTRL + D`, pressing `UP` or `DOWN` to find a target location and pressing `ENTER` to drop or
`ESCAPE` to abort drag. The user can also tab to a different tree within the same tree environment to drop the items
on that tree. The key bindings can be changed via props, see [Keyboard Bindings](/docs/guides/keyboard)
for more details.

:::info
All props that can be provided to the tree environment to control drag and drop capabilities are documented
in the [TreeCapabilities interface](/docs/api/interfaces/treecapabilities).
:::

## Disabled Drag and Drop

By default, drag and drop is disabled. Clicking on items or attempting to drag them will just set the focus
and selected item state on the item clicked on.

```jsx live
function App() {
  return (
    <UncontrolledTreeEnvironment
      dataProvider={new StaticTreeDataProvider(longTree.items, (item, data) => ({ ...item, data }))}
      getItemTitle={item => item.data}
      viewState={{}}
    >
      <Tree treeId="tree-1" rootItem="root" treeLabel="Tree Example" />
    </UncontrolledTreeEnvironment>
  );
}
```

## Only reordering of items allowed

Supplying the `canDragAndDrop` with the value `true` alongside the `canReorderItems` allows the user
to reorder items by clicking on them and dragging them to a new location in the tree.

```jsx live
function App() {
  return (
    <UncontrolledTreeEnvironment
      dataProvider={new StaticTreeDataProvider(longTree.items, (item, data) => ({ ...item, data }))}
      getItemTitle={item => item.data}
      viewState={{}}
      canDragAndDrop={true}
      canReorderItems={true}
    >
      <Tree treeId="tree-2" rootItem="root" treeLabel="Tree Example" />
    </UncontrolledTreeEnvironment>
  );
}
```

## Only dropping on items with children allowed

Supplying the `canDragAndDrop` with the value `true` alongside the `canDropOnItemWithChildren` allows the user
to drop items on other nodes that have the property `hasChildren` set to `true`. Note that this includes empty
containers that have this property set as well. Reordering of items within a parent is not possible without
providing the `canReorderItems` prop.

```jsx live
function App() {
  return (
    <UncontrolledTreeEnvironment
      dataProvider={new StaticTreeDataProvider(longTree.items, (item, data) => ({ ...item, data }))}
      getItemTitle={item => item.data}
      viewState={{}}
      canDragAndDrop={true}
      canDropOnItemWithChildren={true}
    >
      <Tree treeId="tree-3" rootItem="root" treeLabel="Tree Example" />
    </UncontrolledTreeEnvironment>
  );
}
```

## Only dropping on items without children allowed

Supplying the `canDragAndDrop` with the value `true` alongside the `canDropOnItemWithoutChildren` allows the user
to drop items on other nodes that have the property `hasChildren` set to `false`. Note that, in this example,
items dropped on other nodes immediately disappear as target nodes continue to not show any children because
their property `hasChildren` being false.

```jsx live
function App() {
  return (
    <UncontrolledTreeEnvironment
      dataProvider={new StaticTreeDataProvider(longTree.items, (item, data) => ({ ...item, data }))}
      getItemTitle={item => item.data}
      viewState={{}}
      canDragAndDrop={true}
      canDropOnItemWithoutChildren={true}
    >
      <Tree treeId="tree-4" rootItem="root" treeLabel="Tree Example" />
    </UncontrolledTreeEnvironment>
  );
}
```

## Dropping everywhere is allowed

Supplying the props `canDragAndDrop`, `canReorderItems`, `canDropOnItemWithChildren` and `canDropOnItemWithoutChildren`
all with the value `true` allows all possible drop positions to be viable targets.

```jsx live
function App() {
  return (
    <UncontrolledTreeEnvironment
      dataProvider={new StaticTreeDataProvider(longTree.items, (item, data) => ({ ...item, data }))}
      getItemTitle={item => item.data}
      viewState={{}}
      canDragAndDrop={true}
      canReorderItems={true}
      canDropOnItemWithChildren={true}
      canDropOnItemWithoutChildren={true}
    >
      <Tree treeId="tree-5" rootItem="root" treeLabel="Tree Example" />
    </UncontrolledTreeEnvironment>
  );
}
```

## Specifying which items can be dragged

With the `canDrag`, a method can be provided to evaluate whether a certain item can be dragged or not.
The method takes an array of all items currently selected, which are attempted to be dragged. If the method
returns false, the drag is not initiated.

In the following example, only items whose name starts with the letter **A** are allowed to be dragged.

```jsx live
function App() {
  return (
    <UncontrolledTreeEnvironment
      dataProvider={new StaticTreeDataProvider(longTree.items, (item, data) => ({ ...item, data }))}
      getItemTitle={item => item.data}
      viewState={{
        'tree-6': {
          expandedItems: ['Fruit', 'Meals'],
        },
      }}
      canDragAndDrop={true}
      canReorderItems={true}
      canDropOnItemWithChildren={true}
      canDrag={items => items.map(item => item.data.startsWith('A')).reduce((a, b) => a && b, true)}
    >
      <Tree treeId="tree-6" rootItem="root" treeLabel="Tree Example" />
    </UncontrolledTreeEnvironment>
  );
}
```

## Specifying on which items can be dropped

With the `canDropAt`, a method can be provided to evaluate whether a certain item is a viable drop target.
The method takes an array of all items that are being dragged, as well as the drop target on which a drop
was attempted. If the method returns `false`, the drop event is aborted. The method is evaluated for every
drop location at the time when the drag is initiated, and is also visually shown when the user attempts
to drag over possible targets.

Note that, when reordering is allowed, the user can also reorder items within parents that succeed the evaluation
of the `canDropAt` method, but not within parents that do not.

In the following example, only items whose name starts with the letter **A** are considered viable drop targets.

```jsx live
function App() {
  return (
    <UncontrolledTreeEnvironment
      dataProvider={new StaticTreeDataProvider(longTree.items, (item, data) => ({ ...item, data }))}
      getItemTitle={item => item.data}
      viewState={{
        'tree-7': {
          expandedItems: ['Fruit', 'Meals'],
        },
      }}
      canDragAndDrop={true}
      canReorderItems={true}
      canDropOnItemWithChildren={true}
      canDropAt={(items, target) =>
        target.targetType === 'between-items' ? target.parentItem.startsWith('A') : target.targetItem.startsWith('A')
      }
    >
      <Tree treeId="tree-7" rootItem="root" treeLabel="Tree Example" />
    </UncontrolledTreeEnvironment>
  );
}
```
