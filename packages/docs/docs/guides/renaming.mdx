# Renaming Functionality

React Complex Tree provides native renaming capabilities which are enabled by default. They an be disabled
by providing the `canRename` prop with the value `false`.

If renaming is enabled, the user can hit the hotkey `F2`, and the title component of the focused item
is replaced with an input. The rendering of that component can be customized with
[custom render hooks](/docs/guides/rendering). The hotkey [can also be customized](/docs/guides/keyboard).

When the input is blurred, i.e. the user clicks on somewhere else, or presses `escape`, the renaming is aborted,
the input is replaced with the title component again and changes made to the title are omitted. If the user clicks
on the submit button or submits the input by pressing enter, the name of the item is changed.

## Example

```jsx live
function App() {
  return (
    <UncontrolledTreeEnvironment
      dataProvider={new StaticTreeDataProvider(longTree.items, (item, data) => ({ ...item, data }))}
      getItemTitle={item => item.data}
      viewState={{
        'tree-1': {
          expandedItems: ['Fruit', 'Meals'],
        },
      }}
    >
      <Tree treeId="tree-1" rootItem="root" treeLabel="Tree Example" />
    </UncontrolledTreeEnvironment>
  );
}
```

## Example with disabled renaming

If `canRename` is set to false, renaming is disabled.

```jsx live
function App() {
  return (
    <UncontrolledTreeEnvironment
      dataProvider={new StaticTreeDataProvider(longTree.items, (item, data) => ({ ...item, data }))}
      getItemTitle={item => item.data}
      viewState={{
        'tree-2': {
          expandedItems: ['Fruit', 'Meals'],
        },
      }}
      canRename={false}
    >
      <Tree treeId="tree-2" rootItem="root" treeLabel="Tree Example" />
    </UncontrolledTreeEnvironment>
  );
}
```

## Reacting to rename events

### Via `onRenameProp`

Both the `UncontrolledTreeEnvironment` and `ControlledTreeEnvironment` provide a `onRenameItem` prop
to which can be reacted to.

```jsx live
function App() {
  return (
    <UncontrolledTreeEnvironment
      dataProvider={new StaticTreeDataProvider(longTree.items, (item, data) => ({ ...item, data }))}
      getItemTitle={item => item.data}
      viewState={{
        'tree-3': {
          expandedItems: ['Fruit', 'Meals'],
        },
      }}
      canRename={false}
      onRenameItem={(item, name) => alert(`${item.data} renamed to ${name}`)}
    >
      <Tree treeId="tree-3" rootItem="root" treeLabel="Tree Example" />
    </UncontrolledTreeEnvironment>
  );
}
```

### Via `StaticTreeDataProvider`

The `StaticTreeDataProvider` also defines a method that is provided as the second argument to the constructor,
which is invoked if a item is renamed. This method is expected to return the renamed item.

```jsx live
function App() {
  return (
    <UncontrolledTreeEnvironment
      dataProvider={
        new StaticTreeDataProvider(longTree.items, (item, newName) => {
          alert(`${item.data} renamed to ${newName}`);
          return { ...item, data: newName };
        })
      }
      getItemTitle={item => item.data}
      viewState={{
        'tree-4': {
          expandedItems: ['Fruit', 'Meals'],
        },
      }}
      canRename={false}
    >
      <Tree treeId="tree-4" rootItem="root" treeLabel="Tree Example" />
    </UncontrolledTreeEnvironment>
  );
}
```

### Via a custom tree data provider

When implementing a custom tree data provider, a method `onRenameItem` can be implemented to react to rename
events. [Read more on implementing custom tree data providers](/docs/guides/custom-data-provider)
for more details.

## Programmatic interaction

This feature can programmatically be controlled by pulling a React Ref either from the tree environment
or the tree itself, and acting on the Ref object. [Read the documentation on externally interacting
with the tree via Refs](/docs/guides/refs) to find out more.
