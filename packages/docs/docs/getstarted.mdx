# Get Started

The following document shows how React Complex Tree can be installed and used in your
web projects.

## Installation

To start using React Complex Table, install it to your project as a dependency via

```
npm install react-complex-tree
```

or

```
yarn add react-complex-tree
```

## Importing

You can always import any of the entities used in the examples directly as named imports from
the `react-complex-tree` package.

```typescript
import { UncontrolledTreeEnvironment, Tree, StaticTreeDataProvider } from 'react-complex-tree';
```

## Integrating React Complex Tree into your project

After installation, import the package and start using it by creating a new tree environment that
contains a tree instance.

```jsx live
function App() {
  return (
    <UncontrolledTreeEnvironment
      dataProvider={new StaticTreeDataProvider(longTree.items, (item, data) => ({...item, data}))}
      getItemTitle={item => item.data}
      viewState={{}}
    >
      <Tree treeId="tree-1" rootItem="root" treeLabel="Tree Example" />
    </UncontrolledTreeEnvironment>
  );
}
```

The example above uses an [UncontrolledTreeEnvironment](/docs/react/UncontrolledTreeEnvironment), which is
the easiest way to get started as it maintains the tree view state in itself. Inside the environment,
the [Tree](/docs/react/Tree) itself is added to the DOM structure. You can add multiple trees within one
environment, that share a common state. Each tree needs to provide

- An individual ID for the tree, which remains unique for that tree.
- Which item is used as root item for that tree. Different trees may show different items as root.
- Optionally, a label, which is used as accessibility label for that tree to describe it to screen readers.

Individual trees do not provide their own state, but share the state that is provided by the environment.

For the environment, there are three ways to implement your tree environment:

- Use an [UncontrolledTreeEnvironment](/docs/react/UncontrolledTreeEnvironment) and a
  [StaticTreeDataProvider](/docs/api/classes/StaticTreeDataProvider) that provides the items. This is the easiest
  approach and is described below.
- Use an [UncontrolledTreeEnvironment](/docs/react/UncontrolledTreeEnvironment) and implement a custom
  [TreeDataProvider](/docs/api/interfaces/TreeDataProvider). This is similarly easy and provides the ability to
  directly react to change events and define a lazy item-loading strategy. This approach is most likely the best
  way to integrate React Complex Tree in realistic scenarios. This approach is described here TODO
- Use an [StaticTreeDataProvider](/docs/api/classes/StaticTreeDataProvider). This requires you to define your
  own logic to manage the view state, thus requiring the most effort, but also provides the most customizability.
  This approach is described here TODO

## Providing the data for the tree

When integrating React Complex Tree with an uncontrolled environment and a static tree data provider, items
must be provided as [explicit data source](/docs/api/interfaces/explicitdatasource). An example for such
items looks like this:

```typescript jsx
const items = {
  root: {
    index: 'root',
    canMove: true,
    hasChildren: true,
    children: ['child1', 'child2'],
    data: 'Root item',
    canRename: true,
  },
  child1: {
    index: 'child1',
    canMove: true,
    hasChildren: false,
    children: [],
    data: 'Child item 1',
    canRename: true,
  },
  child2: {
    index: 'child2',
    canMove: true,
    hasChildren: false,
    children: [],
    data: 'Child item 2',
    canRename: true,
  },
};
```

Each item needs to implement the [TreeItem](/docs/api/interfaces/treeitem) interface. The `data` attribute
is generic and can contain any kind of data such as objects or strings. The environment then also needs to
implement the `getItemTitle` method, which derives the title of the item given a [TreeItem](/docs/api/interfaces/treeitem)
instance. In our example, where `data` is just a string that contains the title, we can use the trivial
implementation of `getItemTitle={item => item.data}`.
